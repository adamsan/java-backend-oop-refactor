# OOP refactor workshop

## Intro

We will practice the refactoring technique: Replacing conditional with polimorphism.

The first one `Task 1` will be a very simple one, with tests already written.

The second one `Task 2` will be a complicated one.

Here you will need the IDE's automated refactoring capability, aswell as written tests, in order to succeed.

Don't worry, if you can't do it, but try to familiarize yourself with the problem.
